# :sparkles: Welcome to my Pokedex :sparkles:

This is a Pokedex app.
You will find a lot of pokemons (soon more to come!).

Try it here : [try my Pokedex](https://silalonso.github.io/modulo-3-evaluacion-intermedia-silalonso/)

![This is how the app looks like](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/silalonso/modulo-3-evaluacion-intermedia-silalonso/master/src/images/pokedex.jpg)

## How does it work?

When you hover over a pokemon, the the pokemon's card is highlighted.

You can click a pokemon if you like, and the background of its card will change its color.
If you click again, the background color will be removed.

![Normal state of the pokemon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/silalonso/modulo-3-evaluacion-intermedia-silalonso/master/src/images/normal.jpg)

This is pokemon's normal state.

![Clicked state](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/silalonso/modulo-3-evaluacion-intermedia-silalonso/master/src/images/clicked.jpg)

This is the clicked state, with the background on a diferent color than the normal state.
