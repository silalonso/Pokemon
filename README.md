# Pokedesk

This is a Pokedex app.
You can find a lot of pokemons (soon more to come!).

![This is how the app looks like](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/silalonso/modulo-3-evaluacion-intermedia-silalonso/master/src/images/pokedex.jpg)

When you hover over a pokemon, the the pokemon's card is highlighted.

You can click a pokemon if you like, and the background of its card will change its color.
If you click again, the background color will be removed.

This is pokemon's normal state.

![On hover, highlighted state](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/silalonso/modulo-3-evaluacion-intermedia-silalonso/master/src/images/highlighted.jpg)

![Clicked state](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/silalonso/modulo-3-evaluacion-intermedia-silalonso/master/src/images/clicked.jpg)

This is the clicked state, with the background on a diferent color as the normal state.
